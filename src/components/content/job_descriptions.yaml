  description: At Gap Inc. and its associated brands, I was part of a team of UI engineers to help developed a modernized react-based system catered specifically for serving large inventories of apparel to thousands of shoppers a day. As a wider opportunity to modernize their entire tech stack to accompany their new microfrontend layout, I was additionally part of a group-led effort to create automation scripts to bypass and hasten the output of legacy software systems. In the span of 3 months, my team had revamped all of the brands’ seasonal pages from legacy templates to a modern component architechture. Additionally, I helped create a system that enabled the web team’s designers and producers to significantly reduce their time spent mucking around in end of life software systems to being able to release their approved designs into the CI pipeline in the matter of a few seconds.

  description: Enigma is a multi-institutional effort to study the symbiotic impacts that microbial systems and their environments have on each other from a cross disciplinary lens ranging from analytical chemistry to metabolomics. By collecting a wide range of different data about a microbial community in context with where it lives, their hope is to predict complex chemical processes that take place at a cellular level and how it can change the enviornment around them. In order to preserve the composability and reproducibility of their measurements for future efforts, CORAL was developed as a platform for storing ontologically meaningful data in a way that could also easily reproduce findings with little effort. I was key in prototyping and developing CORAL into a usable and working web application and a set of powerful tools for analyzing large quantities of data in an organized and verifiable way. In addition to a fast and easy to use platform for data viewing, I helped develop a powerful set of jupyter-based tools that can connect data from many degrees apart into new and convenient datasets. Coral is an open source platform that can be used under MIT license for storing data available here [at github.com/whatever].

  description: kbase is a data science platform designed for biologists to predict biological function using easy to understand tools with little technical background needed. Users are easily enablerd to analyze their own data against publicly shared data and create an abstraction layer making widely used open source bioinformatics tools and algorithms easy to run and get results. I have helped modernize the user interface for kbase, developing a new platform for use, as well as contribute to and maintain existing applications within the kbase ecosystem that are used by many [does that sounds too obvious that not that many people use it] people on a regular basis to analyze their bio data. Our most recent effort has been in providing full stack support for uploading and keeping track of biological samples in a way that is easy to vizualise any associated datasets.
